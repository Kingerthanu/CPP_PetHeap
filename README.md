# CPP_PetHeap
  Document orientates around the understanding of heaps and their invariants
 it is here to teach basic functions of the ADT like percolate up and down;
 as well as public accessor functions which allow the user to see the state of
 the heap. This could mean seeing the size (amount of pets) of the heap, 
 the actual pets inside the heap and their prioitization. As well as 
 means to add to the heap a new animal.<img src="https://github.com/Kingerthanu/CPP_PetHeap/assets/76754592/73320661-83f3-4b56-8342-58c224a33be9" alt="Cornstarch <3" width="35" height="9">
